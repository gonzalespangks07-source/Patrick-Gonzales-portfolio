# Reflection
Creating my portfolio in GitHub was both a challenging and rewarding experience. One of the main challenges I faced was connecting the CSS and JavaScript files properly so that the design and interactive features of the portfolio would display as expected. At first, my styles were not showing up, and the buttons I created were not functioning. I solved this by carefully checking the file paths and making sure that the CSS and JavaScript were correctly linked in the HTML file. I also used GitHub Pages to publish the portfolio, and I encountered some issues with broken links. To address this, I double-checked the folder structure in my repository and ensured that all assets, such as images and stylesheets, were pushed to the correct directory.

Another challenge was designing the portfolio in a way that is both simple and professional. Since I am not a graphic designer, it was difficult to choose the right colors, fonts, and layouts. I solved this by looking at other portfolio examples online for inspiration and applying a dark mode feature to make the design more modern.

If I were to improve my portfolio next, I would focus on adding more interactive features, such as animations or hover effects, to make it more engaging. I would also consider adding a section for projects with live demos and detailed descriptions, so potential viewers can see my work more clearly. Finally, I would like to improve the responsiveness of the site to ensure it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
